# Discord Channel Spammer
Spams any Discord channel with a message.

## Disclaimer.
Apparently I must put a fucking disclamer here.
DO NOT USE THIS. Seriously. Don't fucking use it. 
It is against the Discord ToS. 
I am not in any way endorsing anyone using this.

## To use:
1. Fill out config.json
	* Can be either a bot or user token.
		* Use user tokens at your own risk. It breaks the Discord ToS.
2. Run index.js.
